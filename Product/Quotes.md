## Point of Product Management

> The point of Product Management is not to put things in Jira in a specific format, use a specific framework for writing out goals, or make sure your developers have full backlogs. The point of Prodcut Management is to create valuable products that customers love.

## Features vs. value

> Cut features instead of trying to cram more features through the same small pipeline (which jams it up). You'll get a better product that way, too.
